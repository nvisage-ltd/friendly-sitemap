# Umbraco Friendly Sitemap

<img src="docs/img/logo.png?raw=true" alt="Umbraco Friendly Sitemap" width="250" align="right" />

Friendly Sitemap makes adding dynamic `sitemap.xml` files to your Umbraco website easy!

Friendly Sitemap creates a fully compliant XML sitemap for Google search, Google Images, or Google News, for your content with no code necessary.

## Getting started

Friendly Sitemap and the [News Sitemap](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Our.Umbraco.FriendlySitemap.News/) are supported on Umbraco 8.1+.

The [Image Sitemap](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Our.Umbraco.FriendlySitemap.Images/) requires Umbraco 8.6+.

### Installation

Friendly Sitemap is available from Our Umbraco, NuGet, or as a manual download directly from GitHub.

#### Our Umbraco repository

You can find a downloadable package on the [Our Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.com/projects/website-utilities/friendly-sitemap/) site.

#### NuGet package repository

To [install from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Our.Umbraco.FriendlySitemap/), run the following command in your instance of Visual Studio.

    PM> Install-Package Our.Umbraco.FriendlySitemap

## Usage

Once installed the sitemap must be enabled via an app setting in the `web.config` file:

```
<add key="Umbraco.Sitemap.Enable" value="true" />
```

To exclude certain document types from the sitemap 
```
<add key="Umbraco.Sitemap.Exclude" value="docType1,doctype2" />
```

The sitemap will be visible on the URL `/sitemap.xml`, such as `https://www.yoursite.com/sitemap.xml`. If installed, the [Image Sitemap](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Our.Umbraco.FriendlySitemap.Images/) will be visible on the URL `/sitemap_images.xml` while the [News Sitemap](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Our.Umbraco.FriendlySitemap.News/) will be visible on the URL `/sitemap_news.xml`.

All links displayed in a sitemap are specific to the current domain and culture.

If a physical `sitemap.xml` file exists in your website, the dynamically generated sitemap will be disabled.

The [project wiki](https://github.com/callumbwhyte/friendly-sitemap/wiki) contains further details about the advanced configuration options available, including creating custom sitemaps.
